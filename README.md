### **Data**
Our squirrel sightings tracker uses Django development to create a Webapplication that tracks the squirrels in 2018 at Central Park. We had to import the squirrel census dataset from the city of new york. 
[2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw)

The user can add, edit and view some statistics on squirrel sightings. The user can also get a visualization of the squirrels location in Central Park on a map.
